## Project: Placement Assistance Chatbot

### Overview

The Placement Assistance Chatbot is designed to help students navigate the placement process by providing relevant information about companies, roles, and interview preparations. The system uses deep learning models, specifically RoBERTa, for intent detection and response generation to offer accurate and personalized assistance.

### Steps to Build the Project

1. **Define the Problem and Objectives**:
    - Identify key features and requirements for the placement assistance chatbot, such as company information, role descriptions, and interview preparation materials.
    - Establish performance metrics, including response accuracy, F1 score, and latency.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
    - Gather data related to placement processes, such as company details, job roles, interview questions, and preparation materials.
    - Preprocess the data to remove irrelevant content and ensure it is clean for training the chatbot.

3. **Choosing Pretrained Models**:
    - Select a pretrained model for intent detection and response generation. For this project, we used the RoBERTa model, fine-tuned on a relevant dataset (SQuAD2.0).

4. **Model Training**:
    - Fine-tune the pretrained RoBERTa model on the placement-related dataset to improve its understanding of domain-specific queries.
    - Train the model to classify the intent of user queries and generate appropriate responses.

5. **Chatbot Architecture**:
    - Develop the query-response flow using the following algorithm:
        - Extract features from the user query using an NLP pipeline.
        - Compute context with the pretrained model.
        - Match the context to the existing patterns in the placement database.
        - Retrieve the answer from the database or generate a fallback response if no match is found.
        - Return the formatted response.

6. **Integration of Placement Database**:
    - Create a database containing information about companies, roles, and interview preparation materials.
    - Use this database to provide personalized responses based on user queries related to placements.

7. **Testing and Evaluation**:
    - Test the chatbot using various queries related to placement assistance.
    - Evaluate performance based on metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, latency, and user feedback.
    - Conduct A/B testing for different intents and responses to optimize user interaction.

8. **Deployment**:
    - Deploy the chatbot on a platform or application where users can interact with it (e.g., website, messaging app).
    - Monitor performance and collect feedback to continually improve the system.

9. **User Feedback and Improvements**:
    - Collect user feedback through surveys or ratings to understand the effectiveness and ease of use of the chatbot.
    - Based on the feedback, continuously improve the model by adding new intents, responses, and features.
